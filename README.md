# T-Matrix Data Format

This repository contains files for generation and storage of T-matrices in hdf5 format using various software, following the specifications described in a dedicated document.  

 
The hdf5 files are located in the example_data directory together with the example python script to retrieve data from an hdf5 file containing the T-matrix of a TiO2 cylinder. The hdf5 file with referential tetrahedron made of spheres is located in reference_data.
